That's not bad.

135
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,510
我猜猜  伯克利毕业的
Let me guess. Berkeley?

136
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,920
其实是布朗大学
Brown, actually.

137
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,300
布朗大学小姐
Well, Ms Brown,

138
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,900
这是个不完美的世界  但我们只有这个世界
it's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we've got.

139
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,640
我向你保证
I guarantee you,

140
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,620
如果哪天再不需要武器来维护和平了
the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace,

141
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,060
我会开始为婴儿医院制造建材的
I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.

142
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,140
这段话常练吗
Rehearse that much?

143
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,890
每晚睡觉前都会对着镜子说
Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime.

144
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,290
-看出来了  -我想让你亲眼见识一下
- I can see that. - I'd like to show you first-hand.

145
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,680
我只想要个严肃的答案
All I want is a serious answer.

146
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,880
好吧  说严肃的  我老爸有个理论
Okay, here's serious. My old man had a philosophy,

147
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,480
"和平就是比对方的棍子大"
"Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy."

148
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,850
卖棍子的人说这话真讨巧
That's a great line coming from the guy selling the sticks.

149
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,140
我父亲帮忙打败了纳粹
My father helped defeat the Nazis.

150
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,570
他还参与了曼哈顿计划[原子弹]

151
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,360
很多人  包括你布朗大学的教授们
A lot of people, including your professors at Brown,

152
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,700
都会认为这叫英雄
would call that being a hero.

153
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,910
也会有很多人称之为战争牟利
And a lot of people would also call that war profiteering.

154
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,960
告诉我  你打算报道我们靠推动医疗科技
Tell me, do you plan to report on the millions we've saved

155
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,570
和改善农业技术
by advancing medical technology

156
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,480
而让千百万人延续寿命  免受饥荒的事吗
or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops?

157
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,210
所有那些突破
All those breakthroughs,

158
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,150
都是由军工提供的资金  亲爱的
military funding, honey.

159
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,290
你这辈子失眠过吗
You ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life?

160
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,250
我愿意跟你失眠几小时
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.

161
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,970
早上好  现在是早7点
Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m.

167
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,940
托尼
Hey, Tony?

168
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,050
你无权进入这个区域
You are not authorised to access this area.

169
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,640
-天呐  -那是贾维斯  他是房子的管家
- Jesus. - That's Jarvis. He runs the house.

170
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,960
这是你的衣服  干洗熨烫过了
I've got your clothes here. They've been dry-cleaned and pressed,

171
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,760
外面有辆车在等着你
and there's a car waiting for you outside

172
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,070
会带你去任何你指定的地方
that will take you anywhere you'd like to go.

173
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,380
-你一定是著名的派珀·波茨  -是的

都这么多年了
After all these years,

175
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,930
托尼还让你替他拿干洗衣物
Tony still has you picking up the dry-cleaning.

176
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,000
我做任何斯塔克先生要我做的事
I do anything and everything that Mr Stark requires,

177
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,870
偶尔也包括倒垃圾
including, occasionally, taking out the trash.

178
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,080
没有别的事了吧
Will that be all?

179
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,400
扩展视图
Give me an exploded view.

180
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,750
3号气缸的气压似乎过低了
The compression in cylinder three appears to be low.

181
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,420
记录一下
Log that.

182
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,540
-我这就再试一次  -请别把我的音乐关小
- I'm gonna try again, right now. - Please don't turn down my music.

183
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,530
我再通知你
I'll keep you posted.

184
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,420
你现在应该在去往地球另一边的路上了

185
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,900
-她接受得如何  -非常好
- How'd she take it? - Like a champ.

186
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,260
你为什么急着赶我走
Why are you trying to hustle me out of here?

187
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,190
你的航班应该是一个半小时前离开的
Your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago.

188
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,620
有意思  我以为考虑到那是我的飞机
That's funny, I thought with it being my plane and all,

189
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,020
它会等我到了再出发呢
that it would just wait for me to get there.

190
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,670
托尼  我有几件事要跟你商量
Tony, I need to speak to you about a couple things

191
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,620
然后我就要送你出门了
before I get you out of the door.

192
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,180
如果你还没到  飞机就飞了
Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose

193
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,160
那有自己的飞机
of having your own plane

194
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,660
不就没意义了吗
if it departs before you arrive?

195
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,910
拉里来电
Larry called.

196
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,990
他为杰克逊·波洛克画找到了新买家
He's got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.

197
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,850
你还想不想要它
Do you want it? Yes or no.

198
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,140
那是他的"春"期代表作吗
Is it a good representation of his spring period?

199
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,190
不是  斯普林斯是他曾生活工作过的
No. The Springs was actually the neighbourhood in East Hampton

200
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,550
一个东汉普顿社区
where he lived and worked,

201
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,200
-并不是春天的"春"  -是吗
- not "spring" like the season. - So?

202
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,910
我觉得还可以  而且定价过高了
I think it's a fair example. I think it's incredibly overpriced.

203
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,210
我要  买  存起来
I need it. Buy it. Store it.

204
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,490
好  麻省理工学院毕业典礼讲话
Okay. The MIT commencement speech...

205
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,650
6月的事  拜托
Is in June. Please,

206
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,850
别拿还没影的事来唠叨我
don't harangue me about stuff that's way, way, down...

207
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,840
他们在唠叨我  我就答应了
They're haranguing me, so I'm gonna say yes.

208
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,610
反弹或吸收
Deflect it and absorb it.

209
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,170
-别传递给我  -你上机前
- Don't transmit it back to me. - I need you to sign this

210
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,520
-我需要你给这个签字  -你干吗非要赶我走
- before you get on the plane. - What are you trying to get rid of me for?

211
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,850
你有安排吗
What, you got plans?

212
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,540
-事实上  真有  -我不喜欢你有安排
- As a matter of fact, I do. - I don't like it when you have plans.

213
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,570
我生日这天是可以有安排的
I'm allowed to have plans on my birthday.

214
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,280
-今天是你生日吗  -嗯
- It's your birthday? - Yes.

215
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,730
我知道的  这就到了吗
I knew that. Already?

216
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,400
是的  多奇怪啊  跟去年是同一天
Yeah. Isn't that strange? It's the same day as last year.

217
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,810
-拿我的钱给自己买点好东西吧  -买了
- Get yourself something nice from me. - I already did.

218
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,480
-怎么样  -可好了
- And? - It was very nice.

219
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,430
-嗯  -很有品味  谢谢  斯塔克先生
- Yeah. - Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr Stark.

220

不客气  波茨小姐
You're welcome, Miss Potts.

221
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,820
好了
Okay.

222
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,960
你挺厉害  我刚刚以为甩掉你了
You're good. I thought I lost you back there.

223
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,500
是这样  先生
You did, sir.

224
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,520
我不得不抄穆赫兰道的捷径
I had to cut across Mulholland.

225
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,080
被我甩掉了吧
I got you. I got you.

226
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,650
你什么毛病
What's wrong with you?

227
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,280
-怎么了  -三小时
- What? - Three hours.

228
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,320
忙着接受《名利场》的采访呢
I got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair.

229
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,500
三小时  你让我在这儿站了三小时
For three hours. For three hours you got me standing here.

230
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,970
现在等你了  走吧  快来
Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on.

231
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,880
起飞  开始吧
Wheels up! Rock and roll!

232
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,380
-你看什么呢  鸭嘴兽  -没事
- What you reading, platypus? - Nothing.

233
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,690
得了  酸糖娃  别生气嘛
Come on, sour patch. Don't be mad.

234
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,590
我说了  我没生气  我不在乎  好吗
I told you, I'm not mad. I'm indifferent, okay?

235
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,050
-我都道歉了  -早上好  斯塔克先生
- I said I was sorry. - Good morning, Mr Stark.

236
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,050
你不用向我道歉
You don't need to apologise to me.

237
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,380
-我是你的哥们  -我都跟他道歉了  但他
- I'm your man. - I told him I was sorry, but he...

238
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,190
-我现在就是不在乎了  -热毛巾要吗
- I'm just indifferent right now. - Hot towel?

239
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,590
你不尊重自己  所以我知道你不尊重我
You don't respect yourself, so I know you don't respect me.

240
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,700
-我尊重你  -我就是你的保姆
- I respect you. - I'm just your babysitter.

241
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,670
如果你需要换尿布了  谢谢
So, when you need your diaper changed... Thank you.

242
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,220
就告诉我  我去给你拿奶瓶  好吗
Let me know and I'll get you a bottle, okay?

243
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,640
加热下清酒  好吗
Heat up the sake, will you?

244
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,130
-多谢提醒我  -我不是说
- Thanks for reminding me. - No, I'm not talking...

245
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,000
我们不喝酒  我们在工作
We're not drinking. We're working right now.

246
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,330
-吃生鱼片一定要配清酒  -你根本就是
- You can't have sashimi without sake. - You are constitutionally

247
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,310
做不到负责任
incapable of being responsible.

248
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,620
不喝酒才不负责
It would be irresponsible not to drink.

249
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,650
不过是一杯睡前酒
I'm just talking about a nightcap.

250
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,880
热清酒
Hot sake?

251
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,730
好  来两杯  谢谢
Yes, two, please.

252
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,310
不  我不喝  我不要
No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any.

253
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,680
我就这意思
That's what I'm talking about.

254
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,680
我早上起床  穿上军服
When I get up in the morning and I'm putting on my uniform,

255
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,790
知道我认得什么吗
you know what I recognise?

256
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,030
我在镜子里能看到
I see in that mirror that

257
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,950
每一个穿着这军服的人都会照应我
every person that's got this uniform on got my back!

258
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,320
知道吗  我跟你不一样  我不适合
Hey, you know what? I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...

259
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,400
不  你不非得像我一样
No, no. You don't have to be like me!

260
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,810
但你远不止现在的你自己
But you're more than what you are.

261
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,880
抱歉  我现在有点无法集中精神
Can you excuse me if I'm a bit distracted here?

262
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,390
不  你现在不能不集中精神  听我说
No! You can't be distracted right now! Listen to me!

263
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,830
{\an8}{\pos(186,190)}阿富汗  巴格兰空军基地

264
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,560
将军
General.

265
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,030
欢迎  斯塔克先生
Welcome, Mr Stark.

266
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,480
我们很期待您的武器展示
We look forward to your weapons presentation.

267
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,440
谢谢
Thanks.

268
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,310
被恐惧和被尊敬  哪个更好
Is it better to be feared or respected?

269
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,640
要我说  两个都要算过分吗
I say, is it too much to ask for both?

270
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,250
因此  我谦卑地献上斯塔克工业
With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel

271
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,160
自由系列的旗舰产品
of Stark Industries' Freedom Line.

272
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,200
这是第一个融入了
It's the first missile system

273
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:52,310
我们的专利冲击科技的导弹系统
to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology.

274
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,390
人说最好的武器是不需要使用的武器
They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire.

275
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,420
我尊重地表示不同意
I respectfully disagree.

276
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:02,720
我更喜欢你只需要使用一次的武器
I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once.

277
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,000
我老爸就这么做  美国就这么做
That's how Dad did it. That's how America does it.

278
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,970
而且到目前一直挺成功
And it's worked out pretty well so far.

279
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,320
找个借口
Find an excuse

280
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:13,750
发射一次这玩意  我亲自担保
to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you

281
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,190
坏蛋再也不会想从洞里爬出来了
the bad guys won't even want to come out of their caves.

282
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,200
供您参考  耶利哥
For your consideration, the Jericho.

283
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,790
每笔超过五亿的交易
I'll be throwing one of these in

284
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,340
我送一个这个
with every purchase of 500 million or more.

285
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,460
敬和平
To peace!

286
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,290
-托尼  -奥比  你怎么起来了
- Tony. - Obie, what are you doing up?

287
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,730
不清楚情况我睡不着  展示得怎么样
I couldn't sleep till I found out how it went. How'd it go?

288
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,110
很好  看来圣诞节要提前了
It went great. Looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas.

289
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,720
好样的  伙计  明天见了
Way to go, my boy! I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

290
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,940
你怎么没穿我送你的睡衣
Why aren't you wearing those pyjamas I got you?

291
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,500
晚安  托尼
Good night, Tony.

292
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,650
-托尼  -抱歉  这辆车是"欢乐马"
- Hey, Tony. - I'm sorry, this is the "Fun-vee."

293
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,520
"悍无聊马"在后面
The "Hum-drum-vee" Is back there.

294
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,480
-好样的  -基地见
- Nice job. - See you back at base.

295
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,140
我劝你别那么做
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

296
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,940
你对我做了什么
What the hell did you do to me?

297
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,060
我做了什么
What I did?

298
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,750
我做的事是救你命
What I did is to save your life.

299
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,250
我已经尽力移除了很多弹片  但还剩不少
I removed all the shrapnel I could, but there's a lot left,

300
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,600
而且它们都在往你的房隔去
and it's headed into your atrial septum.

301
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,090
想看看吗
Here, want to see?

302
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:24,400
我留了纪念品  看看吧
I have a souvenir. Take a look.

303
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,300
我在我的村子里见过不少这样的伤
I've seen many wounds like that in my village.

304
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,820
我们称他们为将死行尸
We call them the walking dead

305
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,990
因为大概要一周
because it takes about a week

306
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,940
弹片才会进入重要器官
for the barbs to reach the vital organs.

307
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,610
-这是什么  -那是块电磁铁
- What is this? - That is an electromagnet,

308
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,770
连在了汽车电池上
hooked up to a car battery,

309
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,480
它在阻止弹片进入你的心脏
and it's keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart.

310
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,400
没错  笑笑
That's right. Smile.

311
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,940
我们见过一次  在伯尔尼的一场科技大会上
We met once, you know, at a technical conference in Bern.

312
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,330
-我不记得了  -当然了
- I don't remember. - No, you wouldn't.

313
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,390
如果我喝得那么醉  肯定站都站不直
If I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand,

314
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,840
更别说就集成电路发表讲话了
much less give a lecture on integrated circuits.

315
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:10,960
我们在哪
Where are we?

316
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,230
快起来  起来
Come on, stand up. Stand up!

317
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,010
学我的样子做
Just do as I do.

318
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,080
把手举起来
Come on, put your hands up.

319
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,940
那是我的枪  他们怎么弄到的
Those are my guns. How did they get my guns?

320
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,190
你听懂了没  学我的样子做
Do you understand me? Do as I do.

321
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:51,140
他说"欢迎  托尼·斯塔克  美国历史上
He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark, the most famous mass murderer

322
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,040
最著名的大屠杀犯"
in the history of America."

323
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,420
他很荣幸
He is honoured.

324
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,380
他要你给他建导弹
He wants you to build the missile.

325
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,340
你展示的那个耶利哥导弹
The Jericho missile that you demonstrated.

326
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,470
这个
This one.

327
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,850
我拒绝
I refuse.

328
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,440
托尼
Tony!

329
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,540
{\an8}斯塔克工业

330
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,800
他问你觉得怎么样
He wants to know what you think.

331
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,730
我觉得你有好多我的武器
I think you got a lot of my weapons.

332
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,270
他说他们有你需要
He says they have everything

333
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,770
拿来建造耶利哥的一切
you need to build the Jericho missile.

334
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,560
他要你列出材料清单
He wants you to make the list of materials.

335
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,450
他说要你立刻开始动手
He says for you to start working immediately,

336
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,570
你做好了  他就放了你
and when you're done, he will set you free.

337
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:55,130
-不  他不会的  -是啊
- No, he won't. - No, he won't.

338
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,280
他们肯定在找你  斯塔克
I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark.

339
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,830
但在这些山里  他们是找不到你的
But they will never find you in these mountains.

340
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,660
你刚刚看到一切
Look, what you just saw,

341
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,480
那就是你的遗产  斯塔克
that is your legacy, Stark.

342
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,420
你一生的心血  落在那些杀人犯手里
Your life's work, in the hands of those murderers.

343
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,020
你想这样死去吗
Is that how you want to go out?

344
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,000
这就是伟大的托尼·斯塔克的
Is this the last act of defiance

345
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,450
最后反抗吗
of the great Tony Stark?

346
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,580
还是说你要想想办法
Or are you going to do something about it?

347
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,720
我何必还要做点什么
Why should I do anything?

348
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,730
他们无论如何都会杀了你  杀了我
They're going to kill me, you, either way.

349
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,090
就算不  我大概也活不过一周
And if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week.

350
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,330
那么
Well, then,

351
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,600
这一周就对你至关重要了吧
this is a very important week for you, isn't it?

352
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,120
如果这里要做我的工作站
If this is going to be my work station,

353
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,910
我要灯火通明  这个竖好
I want it well-lit. I want these up.

354
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,450
我需要焊接工具  乙炔和丙烷的都行
I need welding gear. I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.

355
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,450
我需要焊接工作台
I need a soldering station.

356
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,860
头盔  护目镜
I need helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.

357
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:06,730
我还要熔炼杯  两组精密工具
I would like a smelting cup. I need two sets of precision tools.

358
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,040
{\an8}斯塔克工业

359
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:22,040
-你说多少种语言  -好多种
- How many languages do you speak? - A lot.

360
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,200
但看来在这里还是不够用
But apparently, not enough for this place.

361
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,020
他们说阿拉伯语  乌尔都语
They speak Arabic, Urdu,

362
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,720
达里语  帕施图语
dari, Pashto,

363
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,730
蒙古语  波斯语  俄语
Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.

364
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,900
他们是什么人
Who are these people?

365
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:36,430
他们是你的忠实顾客  先生
They are your loyal customers, sir.

366
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,840
他们自称"十戒组织"
They call themselves the Ten Rings.

367
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,390
如果你告诉我你的计划
You know, we might be more productive

368
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,760
我们的动作可能会更快
if you include me in the planning process.

369
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,110
好吧  我们不需要这个
Okay, we don't need this.

370
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,980
那是什么
What is that?

371
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,800
钯  0.15克
That's palladium, 0.15 grammes.

372
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,210
我们需要至少1.6
We need at least 1.6,

373
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,240
你去把另外11个拆了吧
so why don't you go break down the other 11?

374
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,650
他在干什么
What's he doing?

375
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,790
干活儿
Working.

376
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,950
小心  我们只有一次机会
Careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this.

377
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:37,050
放心  我手很稳
Relax. I have steady hands.

378
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,440
要不你怎么会还活着
Why do you think you're still alive?

379
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,080
-怎么称呼你  -我叫殷森
- What do I call you? - My name is Yinsen.

380
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,520
殷森  认识你很高兴
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.

381
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,330
我也很高兴认识你
Nice to meet you, too.

382
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,200
那看上去不像耶利哥导弹
That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.

383
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,990
因为那是个迷你方舟反应堆
That's because it's a miniaturised arc reactor.

384
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:44,310
我家里有个大的给我的工厂供电
I got a big one powering my factory at home.

385
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,820
这应该足以阻止弹片进入我的心脏
It should keep the shrapnel out of my heart.

386
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,370
但它能产生什么
But what could it generate?

387
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,430
如果我没算错  我通常不会算错
If my math is right, and it always is,

388
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,470
每秒能产生3千兆焦耳
three gigajoules per second.

389
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,280
那足以让你的心跳50辈子
That could run your heart for 50 lifetimes.

390
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,290
或者让什么大玩意跑15分钟
Or something big for 15 minutes.

391
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,440
-这是我们逃离的方法  -是什么
- This is our ticket out of here. - What is it?

392
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,500
摊平了看
Flatten them out and look.

393
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,670
厉害
Impressive.

394
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:50,910
很好
Good.

395
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,850
下得好
Good roll. Good roll.

396
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,020
你还没跟我说你是哪里人
You still haven't told me where you're from.

397
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,120
我来自一个叫科米拉的小镇

- What's up with the love-in? - Don't look at me.

537
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,880
我不知道他是想干什么
I don't know what he's up to.

538
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:47,220
-见到你真好  -我也是
- Good to see you. - Good to see you.

539
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:48,840
我没能跟爸爸说再见
I never got to say goodbye to Dad.

540
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,580
我没能跟我父亲说再见
I never got to say goodbye to my father.

541
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,610
我有些问题想问他
There's questions that I would have asked him.

542
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,180
我想问他对公司的作为怎么看
I would have asked him how he felt about what this company did.

543
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:04,620
他是否有过挣扎  有过怀疑
If he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts.

544
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,530
或许他就完全是
Or maybe he was every inch

545
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:10,140
新闻纪录片里的那个男人
the man we all remember from the newsreels.

546
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:17,010
我看到了年轻的美国人被杀
I saw young Americans killed

547
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:22,030
杀害他们的正是我为了维护他们而制造的武器
by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them.

548
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:24,760
我还看到
And I saw that I

549
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:26,950
我已经成为了
had become part of a system

550
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,540
不愿负担责任的系统的一员
that is comfortable with zero accountability.

551
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:32,720
-斯塔克先生  -本
- Mr Stark! - Hey, Ben.

552
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,640
你在那里经历了什么
What happened over there?

553
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:39,880
我开了眼界  我意识到我可以为
I had my eyes opened. I came to realise that I have more

554
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:44,310
这世界做更多  而不只是制造爆炸
to offer this world than just making things that blow up.

555
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,980
因此  即刻生效  我要关闭
And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down

556
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:50,920
斯塔克国际公司的武器生产部
the weapons manufacturing division of Stark lnternational

557
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,230
直到
until such a time

558
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,870
我决定好公司的未来
as I can decide what the future of the company will be.

559
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,760
-大家这下不愁  -决定好它的走向
- I think we're gonna be... -  What direction it should take,

560
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:59,300
-卖不出报纸了  -我能接受的
- selling a lot of newspapers. - one that l'm comfortable with

561
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:01,580
并且与国家最高利益
and is consistent with the highest good

562
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:03,120
一致的走向
for this country, as well.

563
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,540
我们应该记住的
What we should take away from this

564
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:09,870
是托尼回来了
is that Tony's back!

565
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,610
而且非常健康
And he's healthier than ever.

566
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:15,670
我们将进行内部探讨
We're going to have a little internal discussion

567
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,150
随后向大家通报
and we'll get back to you with the follow-up.

568
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,710
-他人呢  -在里面
- Where is he? - He's inside.

569
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:36,490
那...挺顺利嘛
Well, that... That went well.

570
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,930
我是在脑后放了个靶子吗
Did I just paint a target on the back of my head?

571
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,350
你的脑袋  那我的脑袋呢
Your head? What about my head?

572
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,910
你觉得明天股价
What do you think the over-under on the stock

573
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,530
会跌到什么程度
drop is gonna be tomorrow?

574
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:47,670
-乐观估计  40点  -至少
- Optimistically, 40 points. - At minimum.

575
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,000
是啊
Yep.

576
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:52,530
托尼  我们是武器制造商
Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.

577
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:55,210
奥比  我不希望我们将来只留下杀伤数字
Obie, I just don't want a body count to be our only legacy.

578
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:56,340
这是我们的工作
That's what we do.

579
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,170
我们是铁商  我们制造武器
We're iron mongers. We make weapons.

580
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,120
大楼上是我的名字
It's my name on the side of the building.

581
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:02,000
我们的工作让世界不会陷入混乱
And what we do keeps the world from falling into chaos.

582
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:03,460
我看到的可不是这样
Not based on what I saw.

583
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,130
我们做得不够好
We're not doing a good enough job.

584
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:07,350
我们可以做得更好  我们要做别的
We can do better. We're gonna do something else.

585
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,590
什么别的  你要我们做奶瓶吗
Like what? You want us to make baby bottles?

586
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:14,830
我认为我们该重新考虑方舟反应堆科技
I think we should take another look into arc reactor technology.

587
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:19,340
得了  方舟反应堆就是个噱头
Come on. The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

588
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,240
托尼  拜托
Tony, come on.

589
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,660
我们建这个是为了堵嬉皮士的嘴
We built that thing to shut the hippies up!

590
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:26,370
-成功了  -是啊  作为科学项目
- It works. - Yeah, as a science project.

591
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,800
方舟反应堆的效益性根本不好
The arc was never cost effective.

592
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:29,720
我们建造之前就知道了
We knew that before we built it.

593
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:32,940
方舟反应堆科技是个死胡同  是吧
Arc reactor technology, that's a dead end, right?

594
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:33,990
或许吧
Maybe.

595
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,380
是吧  我们在这方面多久没有突破了
Am I right? We haven't had a breakthrough in that in what?

596
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:39,160
-30年吗  -据说是的
- Thirty years. - That's what they say.

597
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,700
你的扑克脸能更糟点吗  告诉我  谁说的
Could you have a lousier poker face? Just tell me, who told you?

598
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:47,950
-别管了  给我看  -罗德还是派珀
- Never mind who told me. Show me. - It's Rhodey or Pepper.

599
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,950
-我要看  -好吧  是罗德
- I want to see it. - Okay, Rhodey.

600
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,540
-好吧  -行吗
- Okay. - Okay?

601
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:04,580
成功了
It works.

602
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:13,020
听我说  托尼  我们是一队的  懂吗
Listen to me, Tony. We're a team. Do you understand?

603
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:16,270
只要我们合力  没什么是做不到的
There's nothing we can't do if we stick together,

604
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,900
就像当年我和你父亲
like your father and I.

605
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:19,940
抱歉我没提前跟你商量
I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads-up, okay?

606
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:21,280
-但如果我说了  -托尼
- But if I had... - Tony.

607
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:24,700
托尼  别再干这种脱口而出的事了
Tony, no more of this "ready, fire, aim" business.

608
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:26,570
-明白吗  -那是老爸常说的话
- You understand me? - That was Dad's line.

609
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,190
你得让我来处理
You gotta let me handle this.

610
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,560
我们现在得玩另一套把戏了
We're gonna have to play a whole different kind of ball now.

611
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:34,610
我们要承受很大压力
We're going to have to take a lot of heat.

612
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:38,080
我要你保证  你会低调些
I want you to promise me that you're gonna lay low.

613
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:39,930
斯塔克工业
Stark lndustries!

614
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:43,090
我给你推荐条路  准备好了吗
I've got one recommendation! Ready? Ready?

615
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:44,230
卖卖卖
Sell, sell, sell!

616
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,480
弃船
Abandon ship!

617
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:49,950
兴登堡飞艇的事记得吗
Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?

618
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:52,120
我给大家看看
Let me show you

619
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:56,390
新斯塔克工业的商业计划
the new Stark lndustries business plan!

620
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:01,680
这就是一家不造武器的武器公司
Look, that's a weapons company that doesn't make weapons!

621
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:05,050
派珀  你的手有多大
Pepper. How big are your hands?

622
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:07,580
-什么  -你的手有多大
- What? - How big are your hands?

623
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:10,630
-我不懂这...  -下来  我需要你
- I don't understand why... - Get down here. I need you.

624
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,470
伸出来  给我看看你的手
Let's see them. Show me your hands.

625
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,620
给我看看
Let's see them.

626
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:27,540
好小  好精巧
They are small. Very petite, indeed.

627
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:30,370
我需要你帮个忙
I just need your help for a sec.

628
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,700
天呐  那就是维系你生命的东西吗
Oh, my God, is that the thing that's keeping you alive?

629
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:36,900
之前是  现在是古董了
It was. It is now an antique.

630
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:39,920
这个将在未来一段时间内维系我的生命
This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future.

631
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:41,450
我要换升级版的
I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit,

632
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,500
现在遭遇了点障碍
and I just ran into a little speed bump.

633
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:46,240
障碍  什么意思
Speed bump, what does that mean?

634
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,380
没事  就是个小问题
It's nothing. It's just a little snag.

635
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:51,060
这个装置下面有条暴露的电线
There's an exposed wire under this device.

636
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:52,540
接触到了槽壁
And it's contacting the socket wall

637
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,180
造成了短路
and causing a little bit of a short.

638
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:56,460
没事的
It's fine.

639
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,400
-你要我做什么  -放在那边桌上
- What do you want me to do? - Put that on the table over there.

640
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:00,720
-那个没用了  -天呐
- That is irrelevant. - Oh, my God!

641
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:02,180
你伸手进去
I want you to reach in,

642
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:04,550
轻轻地把电线拉出来
and you're just gonna gently lift the wire out.

643
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,860
-安全吗  -应该没事
- Is it safe? - Yeah, it should be fine.

644
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:09,270
就像手术游戏  别让电线
It's like Operation. You just don't let it

645
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,530
碰到槽壁就行  否则就会发出哔声
touch the socket wall or it goes "beep."

646
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:12,360
什么"手术游戏"
What do you mean, "Operation"?

647
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,700
就是个游戏  算了
It's just a game, never mind.

648
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:16,030
-轻轻地把电线拉出来  -好
- Just gently lift the wire. - Okay.

649
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:17,920
好吗  很好
Okay? Great.

650
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,190
我觉得我做这个不够格
You know, I don't think that I'm qualified to do this.

651
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:26,200
你可以的  你是我认识的最够格
No, you're fine. You're the most capable, qualified,

652
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:29,770
最值得信赖的人  你会做得很棒的
trustworthy person I've ever met. You're gonna do great.

653
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:33,010
这个要求太过分了吗  因为我
Is it too much of a problem to ask? 'Cause I'm...

654
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,070
-好吧  -我真的需要你帮忙
- Okay, okay. - I really need your help here.

655
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:36,940
好了
Okay.

656
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:42,970
有脓液
Oh, there's pus!

657
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:43,920
不是脓液
It's not pus.

658
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:47,590
是装置释放出的无机原生质
It's an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device,

659
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,790
-不是我身体分泌的  -好臭
- not from my body. - It smells!

660
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,950
是啊
Yeah, it does.

661
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:54,010
铜线  铜线  摸到了吗
The copper wire. The copper wire, you got it?

662
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,500
-好  摸到了  -摸到了吗
- Okay, I got it! I got it! - Okay, you got it?

663
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:58,400
拉出来时不要碰到槽壁
Now, don't let it touch the sides when you're coming out!

664
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:00,660
-我之前就是跟你强调这个  -抱歉
- That's what I was trying to tell you before. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

665
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:03,110
拉出来时  一定不要拉出...
Okay, now make sure that when you pull it out, you don't...

666
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,570
最末端的磁铁
There's a magnet at the end of it!

667

What's wrong?

671
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:12,350
没事  我就是要心脏骤停了
Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest

672

682

我只有你
I don't have anyone but you.

690
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:58,970

00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:13,990
你不想留着吗
You don't want to keep it?

695
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,890
派珀  人们说我有很多特点
Pepper, I've been called many things.

696
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,670
但不包括"怀旧"
"Nostalgic" is not one of them.

697
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:20,450
没别的事了吧  斯塔克先生
Will that be all, Mr Stark?

698
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,050
没事了  波茨小姐
That will be all, Miss Potts.

699

笨手笨脚  过来
Hey, Butterfingers, come here.

700
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,210
我桌上这堆东西怎么回事
What's all this stuff doing on top of my desk?

那是我的手机  那是我跟爸爸的合照
That's my phone, that's a picture of me and my dad.

那里  垃圾堆里
Right there. In the garbage. All that stuff.

703
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:44,290
空中战斗的未来  是有人还是无人
The future of air combat. Is it manned or unmanned?

704
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,500
以我的经验
I'll tell you, in my experience,

705
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:48,670
无人机永远
no unmanned aerial vehicle

706
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:51,630
比不过飞行员的直觉
will ever trump a pilot's instinct,

707
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,080
见解

以及看透表象

709
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:59,770
确定结果的判断力
and discern its outcome, or a pilot's judgement.

710
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:02,790
中校  何不让飞行员摆脱飞机
Colonel? Why not a pilot without the plane?

711
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,030
看看是谁从天而降  托尼·斯塔克先生
Look who fell out of the sky. Mr Tony Stark.

712
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:06,800
-你好  先生  -说到有人无人[是不是男人]
- Hello, sir. - Speaking of manned or unmanned,

713

你们一定要问他
you gotta get him to tell you

714
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:09,200
有年春假猜错答案的那次
about the time he guessed wrong at spring break.

715
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,560
记住  春假  1987年
Just remember that, spring break, 1987.

719
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:16,890
他们会信的  别闹
They'll believe it. Don't do that.

720
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:18,080
-好吧  -别闹

723
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,630
我没想到这么快就能见到你起来走动
I swear, I didn't expect to see you walking around so soon.

724
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:30,450
我可不止是走动
I'm doing a little better than walking.

725
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:31,840
-真的  -嗯
- Really? - Yeah.

726
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:34,430

很多人开心起来了
a whole lot of people around here real happy,

730
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,290
因为之前记者招待会上的那个表演
'cause that little stunt at the press conference,

731
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:46,630
太逗了

这不是给军队的  我不...这不一样
This is not for the military. I'm not... It's different.

-我需要你听我说  -不
- I need you to listen to me. - No.

735

Shall I store this on the Stark lndustries Central Database?

743
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,990
其实  我不知道现在能信任谁
Actually, I don't know who to trust right now.

744
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:34,010
直到我另说
Till further notice,

745
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:36,180
先把东西都存在我的私人服务器上吧

746
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,720
在研究秘密项目吗  先生

我不希望这玩意落入坏人之手
I don't want this winding up in the wrong hands.

748

00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:01,100
算了  别动
Screw it. Don't even move.

756
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,940
你真是个悲剧
You are a tragedy.

757
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,670
好了  我们好好做吧
Okay, let's do this right.

758
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:19,900
开始量步  半米  正中央
Start mark, half a metre, and back and centre.

759
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:25,490
呆呆  精神点  准备灭火
Dummy, look alive. You're on standby for fire safety.

760
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:26,900
你  开拍
You, roll it.

761
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:33,040
好  启动手动控制
Okay. Activate hand controls.

762
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,510
慢慢开始
We're gonna start off nice and easy.

763
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:41,380
看看10%的推进能量能否实现上升
We're gonna see if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift.

764
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:42,880

我一直在摁铃  没听到对讲机响吗
I've been buzzing you. Did you hear the intercom?

769
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:30,330
嗯  都...什么

772
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:35,460
好
Okay.

773
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:38,330
你不是说你不做武器了吗
I thought you said you were done making weapons.

774
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:39,280
是的
It is.

775
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:43,310
这是飞行稳定器  完全无害
This is a flight stabiliser. It's completely harmless.

776
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:48,790
这我没料到
I didn't expect that.

777
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:54,960
怎么样
How'd it go?

778
00:57:57,970 --> 00:57:59,320
那么不顺利啊
It went that bad, huh?

779
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,010
就因为我从纽约带了披萨回来
Just because I brought pizza back from New York

780
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:03,670
不代表就不顺利
doesn't mean it went bad.

781
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:06,000
当然了  天呐
Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

782
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,090
如果你去了还能顺利点
It would have gone better if you were there.

783
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:10,750
你叫我低调的  所以我照做了
You told me to lay low. That's what I've been doing.

784
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:12,130
我低调  你处理好...
I lay low, and you take care of all...

785
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:15,950
拜托  那是指在公众  媒体面前
Hey, come on. In public. The press.

786
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,030

是董事会会议吗
This was a board of directors meeting?

788
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:24,230
董事会称你患了创伤后应激症
The board is claiming you have post traumatic stress.

789
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:25,410
他们提交了禁止令

790
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:27,550
-什么  -他们要阻拦你
- A what? - They want to lock you out.

791
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:28,980
怎么  因为股票跌了40点吗
Why, 'cause the stocks dipped 40 points?

792
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:29,850
我们早知道会这样
We knew that was gonna happen.

793
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:32,100
-是56.5  -这无所谓
- Fifty-six and a half. - It doesn't matter.

794
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,360
我们拥有公司的控股权
We own the controlling interest in the company.

795
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:37,840
托尼  董事会也有权利
Tony, the board has rights, too.

796
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:42,000
他们称  你和你的新方向
They're making the case that you and your new direction

797
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,340
-对公司不是最有利的  -我这是负责任
- isn't in the company's best interest. - I'm being responsible!

798
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:47,160
这是我和公司的新方向
That's a new direction for me, for the company.

799
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:49,970
我要代表公司
I mean, me on the company's behalf

800
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:51,970
负起责任
being responsible for the way that...

801
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,500

This is great.

802
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:56,670
-得了  托尼  -我去工作室
- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony. - I'll be in the shop.

803
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:58,910
托尼  听我说
Tony. Listen.

804
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:00,920
我在努力挽回局面
I'm trying to turn this thing around,

805
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,530
但你得给我点东西
but you gotta give me something.

806
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:04,080
拿给他们看的东西
Something to pitch them.

807
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,680
让工程师分析下那个
Let me have the engineers analyse that.

808
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:07,840
画出参数图纸
You know, draw up some specs.

809
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,870
-不行  绝对不行  -让我有根骨头丢给
- No. No, absolutely not. - It'll give me a bone to throw the boys

810
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:11,740
-这个留在我身上  -纽约的人
- This one stays with me. - in New York!

811
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:12,760
就是这样  奥比  别想了
That's it, Obie. Forget it.

812
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,570
好  那这个留在我这儿
All right, well, this stays with me, then.

813
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,390
来吧  你可以拿走一块

-拿两个吧  -谢谢

815
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:20,080
我可以下去看看你在做什么吗
You mind if I come down there and see what you're doing?

816
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,250
晚安  奥比
Good night, Obie.

817
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:25,960
第11天  第37次测试  配置2.0
Day 11 , test 37, configuration 2.0.

818
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,150
因为没有更好的选择
For lack of a better option,

819
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:30,050
仍由呆呆负责灭火  你再敢喷我
Dummy is still on fire safety. If you douse me again,

820
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:32,700
而且是我没着火时  我就把你捐给城市学院
and I'm not on fire, I'm donating you to a city college.

821
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:34,330
慢慢来
All right, nice and easy.

822
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:39,890
真的  就从1%推进能量开始
Seriously, just gonna start off with 1% thrust capacity.

823

三  二  一
And three, two, one.

824

好的
Okay.

825
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:59,040
别拿那玩意时刻指着我
Please don't follow me around with it, either,

826
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:01,790
让我觉得我随时会自燃
'cause I feel like I'm gonna catch on fire spontaneously.

827
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:03,620
退后点  如果真出事了再冲上来
Just stand down! If something happens, then come in.

828
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:05,650
再来  能量加到2.5%
And again, let's bring it up to 2.5.

829

834
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:46,310
好
Okay.

835
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:04,350
不
No!

836
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:09,260
好啊  我能飞了
Yeah, I can fly.

837
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:16,220
-贾维斯  在吗  -随时候命  先生
- Jarvis, are you there? - At your service, sir.

838

好的  先生
Will do, sir.

841
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,860
好  怎么样
All right, what do you say?

842
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,860
我已经上传好了  先生
I have indeed been uploaded, sir.

843
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,450
我们已经上线  准备好了
We're online and ready.

844
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:36,050
可以开始虚拟行走吗

845
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:39,190
正在输入偏好  校准虚拟环境
Importing preferences and calibrating virtual environment.

846
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:40,780
检查控制表面

850
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:11,080
并监听地面控制
Start listening in on ground control.

851
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,290
先生  真正飞行之前
Sir, there are still terabytes

852
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:15,070
还需要进行兆兆字节的计算
of calculations needed before an actual flight is...

853
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:19,020
贾维斯  有时候要先跑才能走
Jarvis! Sometimes you got to run before you can walk.

854
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:23,590
准备好了吗  三  二  一
Ready? In three, two, one.

855

操作流畅
Handles like a dream.

856
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,280
好了  看看这玩意的本事如何
All right, let's see what this thing can do.

857
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,640
SR-71侦察机的记录是多少
What's SR-71's record?

858
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:23,550
固定翼飞行的飞行高度记录为8.5万英尺
The altitude record for fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.

859
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:25,960
记录就是用来打破的  来啊
Records are made to be broken! Come on!

860
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,930
先生  出现了可能致命的结冰
Sir, there is a potentially fatal buildup of ice occurring.

861
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:34,660
继续走
Come on!

862
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:37,810
再高点
Higher!

863
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:54,290
我们结冰了  贾维斯  展开襟翼
We iced up, Jarvis! Deploy flaps!

864
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,460
贾维斯
Jarvis!

865
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:00,670
拜托  我们得除冰
Come on, we got to break the ice!

866
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:37,420
关闭动力
Kill power.

867
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:08,820
{\an8}派珀送

868
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:25,310
{\an8}托尼·斯塔克有心的证明

869
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:05,410
记录  主传感器在4万英尺以上变得迟缓
Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish at plus 40 altitude.

870
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:07,280
壳体增压是个问题
Hull pressurisation is problematic.

871
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,960
我认为结冰可能是影响因素
I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.

872
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,170
观察敏锐  先生
A very astute observation, sir.

873
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:13,960
或许  如果您打算造访其他星球
Perhaps, if you intend to visit other planets,

874
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:15,610
我们应该改进排气系统
we should improve the exo systems.

875
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:18,230
与思科连接  重新配置外壳金属
Connect to the Cisco. Have it reconfigure the shell metals.

876
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:21,400
使用六翼天使战术卫星的金钛合金
Use the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite.

877
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,250
这样应该能保证外壳不受损
That should ensure a fuselage integrity

878
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:25,410
而不影响动力-重量比
while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.

879
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:26,680
-知道了吗  -是
- Got it? - Yes.

880
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:29,210
我要按提议方案进行渲染吗
Shall I render using proposed specifications?

881
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:30,290
好好发挥吧
Thrill me.

贾维斯  我们收到邀请了吗
Jarvis, we get an invite for that?

888
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:46,460
我没有邀请的记录  先生
I have no record of an invitation, sir.

889
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:48,070
自从那场怪异
...hasn't been seen in public

890
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:51,940
且极具争议的记者招待会后就未曾公开露面
since his bizarre and highly controversial press conference.

891
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,690
有些人称他患有创伤后应激症
Some claim he's suffering from post traumatic stress

892
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:58,620
已经卧床数周  不管真相如何
and has been bedridden for weeks. Whatever the case may be,

893
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:01,770
没有人指望他今晚出现
no one expects an appearance from him tonight.

894
01:07:01,770 --> 01:07:03,310
渲染已完成
The render is complete.

895
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,670
有点招摇了吧
A little ostentatious, don't you think?

896
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:08,500
我怎么想的  您一般都很低调的
What was I thinking? You're usually so discreet.

897
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:13,120
这样吧  加上点火红色
Tell you what. Throw a little hot-rod red in there.

898
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:15,550
嗯  这样就低调了
Yes, that should help you keep a low profile.

899
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:20,850
渲染完成
The render is complete.

900
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,480
我喜欢  制造上色吧

这世界是怎么了
What's the world coming to

911
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:15,640
来自己的派对都没有请柬
when a guy's got to crash his own party?

912
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:17,720
看看你
Look at you.

913
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:20,910
真是意外

听着  悠着点
Listen, take it slow, all right?

916
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,370
我觉得我已经安抚好董事会了
I think I got the board right where we want them.

917
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:31,000
好嘞  我就是憋坏了  就玩一会儿
You got it. Just cabin fever. I'll just be a minute.

918
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:38,260
给我杯威士忌  我饿死了
Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.

919
01:08:39,310 --> 01:08:40,310
斯塔克先生
Mr Stark?

920
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,970
-怎么  -科尔森特工

攻击与后勤保障局

924
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,410
天呐  你们需要新名字了
God, you need a new name for that.

925
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:52,230
是啊  我常听人这么说

还有很多问题未得到解答
There's still a lot of unanswered questions,

929
01:08:58,590 --> 01:09:01,070
这种事情  时间有时很重要
and time can be a factor with these things.

930
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:02,650
我们约个时间吧
Let's just put something on the books.

931
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:06,690
24日晚7点在斯塔克工业见如何
How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m. at Stark Industries?

01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:46,880
没有
No. No.

944

我总忘记擦除臭剂

945
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:52,600
还当着我所有同事的面穿一件露背裙子
and dance with my boss in front of everyone that I work with

946
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,310
跟我的老板跳舞

But I could fire you if that would take the edge off.

949
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:03,120
我觉得没了我你恐怕都不会系鞋带了
I actually don't think that you could tie your shoes without me.

- You're missing just a couple of digits there. - The other eight?

955
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,060
另外八个有你嘛
So I got you for the other eight.

956
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:35,620
-出去透口气吧  -嗯  我需要透口气
- How about a little air? - Yes, I need some air.

957
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:40,010
-那感觉太怪了  -完全没关系
- That was totally weird. - Totally harmless.

958
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:42,910
才不是没关系
It was totally not harmless, by the way.

959
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:43,870
我们跳了支舞
We're dancing.

960
01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:45,580
-都没人看  -我的所有同事

961
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:46,460
不是的  知道为什么吗
No, you know why?

962
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:47,220
我觉得你不够客观
I think you lost objectivity.

963
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:48,710
我觉得他们就是...人而已
I think they just... People...

964
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:49,620
我们就是跳了个舞
We just danced.

965
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:50,820
不  不只是跳舞
No, it was not just a dance.

966
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:53,000
你不懂  因为你是你
You don't understand because you're you.

967
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,740
所有人都清楚你是什么样的人
And everybody knows exactly who you are

968
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:57,560
你怎么对待女人什么的
and how you are with girls and all of that,

969
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,240
这没什么关系
which is completely fine.

970
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:01,710
但我  你是我的老板
But, you know, then me, you're my boss,

971
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:03,130
我跟你跳舞

972
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:04,960
-我觉得没人会那么想的  -这让我显得
- I don't think it was taken that way. - Because it makes me look like

973
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,510
好像在
the one who's trying to...

974
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:08,700
-我觉得你想多了  -我们又来到这里
- I just think you're overstating it. - You know, and we're here,

975
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:12,490
我还穿着这件荒唐的
and then I'm wearing this ridiculous

976
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:15,400
裙子  我们还那样跳舞

我真的差点相信了

我出门了几个月  没听说吗
I was out of town for a couple months, in case you didn't hear.

997

1006

我曾经很天真
You know what? I was naive before,

1007
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:55,450
他们说  "这条线  我们不要越过

是我提出了针对你的禁止令
I was the one who filed the injunction against you.

1015

只有这样我才能保护你

被归咎于一群外国士兵
attributed to a group of foreign fighters

1030
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:12,980
他们被当地人称为十戒组织
referred to by locals as the Ten Rings.

1031

可以看到  他们军备齐全  而且目的明确
As you can see, these men are heavily armed and on a mission.

01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:46,400
-不能  -无法识别
- Negative, negative. - Cannot identify.

1069
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,090
马上把武器研发的罗德中校叫来
Get me Colonel Rhodes from Weapons Development down here now!

1070
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:56,750
我们查了身份
We ran an ID check

1071
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:58,770
并交叉对比了所有已知数据库
and cross-referenced with all known databases.

1072
01:19:58,770 --> 01:19:59,580
毫无发现
We have nothing.

1073
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:01,730
当地有高空监控吗
Any high altitude surveillance in the region?

1074
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:03,550
当地有空中早期预警和全球鹰
We got an AWAC and a Global Hawk in the area.

1075
01:20:03,550 --> 01:20:05,230
这玩意是突然冒出来的吗
So this thing just appeared out of nowhere?

1076
01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:06,800
怎么会没在雷达上发现
How come it didn't show up on the radar?

1077
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,790
只有很小的雷达截面  长官
Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.

1078
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:11,130
-隐形的吗  -不是  长官  它很小
- Is it stealth? - No, sir, it's tiny.

1079
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,190
应该是无人机
We think it's an unmanned aerial vehicle.

1080
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,300
中校  这是什么情况
Colonel, what are we dealing with here?

1081
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:20,430
-我去打个电话  -中士  清条线路
- Let me make a call. - Sergeant, clear a hole.

1082
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:26,330
-喂  -托尼
- Hello? - Tony?

1083
01:20:26,330 --> 01:20:28,220
-谁啊  -罗德
- Who's this? - It's Rhodes.

1084
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:30,480
-抱歉  谁  -我说是罗德
- Sorry, hello? - I said it's Rhodes.

1085
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:33,200
-请大点声  -那是什么噪音
- Speak up, please. - What in the hell is that noise?

1086
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,070
嗯  我敞篷开车呢
Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.

1087
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:36,960
我现在需要你帮忙
Yeah, well, I need your help right now.

1088
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,320
天道好轮回啊
It's funny how that works, huh?

1089
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,420
是啊  是这样
Yeah. Speaking of funny,

1090
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:41,770
有个武器站刚被炸毁了
we've got a weapons depot that was just blown up

1091
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:43,610
离你当初被囚的地方只有几公里
a few clicks from where you were being held captive.

1092
01:20:43,610 --> 01:20:45,380
那里挺危险的
Well, that's a hot spot.

1093
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:47,820
似乎是有人插手替你完成了工作  是吧
Sounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you, huh?

1094
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:49,080
你为什么气喘吁吁的  托尼
Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?

1095
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,330
我没有  我在峡谷里慢跑呢
I'm not, I was justjogging in the canyon.

1096
01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:52,230
-你不是在开车吗  -是啊  我开车
- I thought you were driving. - Right, I was driving

1097
01:20:52,230 --> 01:20:54,030
到了峡谷  然后去慢跑
to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.

1098
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:55,230
你在那一带真没有什么
You sure you don't have any tech

1099
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:56,610
我应该知道的东西吗
in that area I should know about?

1100
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:58,240
-没有  -发现不明物体了
- Nope! - Bogey spotted!

1101
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,570
鞭子战机  正在前往
Whiplash, come in hot.

1102
01:20:59,570 --> 01:21:01,450
很好  因为我眼前就有个东西
Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one right now,

1103
01:21:01,450 --> 01:21:03,500
马上要被炸飞了
and it's about to be blown to kingdom come.

1104
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:05,980
我该撤了
That's my exit.

1105
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,830
战情室  这里是鞭子一号
Ballroom, this is Whiplash One.

1106
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:14,530
我看到不明物体了
I've got the bogey in my sights.

1107
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:16,730
鞭子一号  那是什么玩意
Whiplash One, what is it?

1108
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:18,110
我不知道
I've got no idea.

1109
01:21:18,110 --> 01:21:20,570
-能进行无线电联络吗  -无反应  长官
- You have radio contact? - Non responsive, sir.

1110
01:21:20,570 --> 01:21:22,200
那你可以交火
Then you are clear to engage.

1111
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:24,560
{\an8}超音速飞行

1112
01:21:23,690 --> 01:21:24,690
启动
Hit it.

1113
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,910
不明物体刚进入了超音速  我锁定了
That bogey just went supersonic. I got a lock!

1114
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:39,070
-导弹来袭  -照明弹
- lnbound missile. - Flares!

1115
01:21:41,530 --> 01:21:43,500
等等  不明物体调用了照明弹
Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!

1116
01:21:58,490 --> 01:21:59,560
展开襟翼
Deploy flaps!

1117
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:01,910
我去
Holy!

1118
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:03,780
那玩意从雷达上消失了  长官
That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.

1119
01:22:03,790 --> 01:22:05,430
卫星盯丢了
The sat visual has been lost.

1120
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:07,290
那绝不是无人机
No way that's a UAV.

1121
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:08,370
是什么
What is it?

1122
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:09,800
我什么都看不到
I can't see anything.

1123
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,300
不管是什么  刚刚已经死了
Whatever it was, it just bought the farm.

1124
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,010
不明物体应该已经被处理掉了  长官
I think bogey's been handled, sir.

1125
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:26,840
-喂  -罗德  是我
- Hello? - Hi, Rhodey, it's me.

1126
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:28,670
-谁  -抱歉  确实是我
- It's who? - I'm sorry, it is me.

1127
01:22:28,670 --> 01:22:30,010
你问了  你问的那个就是我
You asked. What you were asking about is me.

1128
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:31,600
瞧  这不是游戏
No, see, this isn't a game.

1129
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,840
你不能把平民装备飞入我的活动战区
You do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone.

1130
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,060
-你懂不懂  -不是一件装备
- You understand that? - This is not a piece of equipment.

1131
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:39,700
我在里面呢  是件战衣  那是我
I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!

1132
01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:41,460
罗德  你查到什么了吗
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

1133
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:46,270
-标记位置  回基地  -收到  战情室
- Mark your position and return to base. - Roger that, Ballroom.

1134
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,110
在你底下
On your belly!

1135
01:22:50,110 --> 01:22:52,210
像是个人
lt looks like a man!

1136
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:54,910
甩掉他  翻滚
Shake him off! Roll! Roll!

1137
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,470
我被打中了
I'm hit! I'm hit!

1138
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:06,120
确认  他被击中了
It's confirmed. He has been hit.

1139
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,300
跳伞
Punch out! Punch out!

1140
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:20,880
鞭子一号坠机
Whiplash One down.

1141
01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:22,700
鞭子二号  看到降落伞了吗
Whiplash Two, do you see a chute?

1142
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,970
没有  没有降落伞
Negative! No chute, no chute!

1143
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:31,930
我的降落伞卡住了
My chute's jammed!

1144
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:40,030
长官  我看到不明物体了
Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey.

1145
01:23:40,230 --> 01:23:41,430
鞭子二号  再次出击
Whiplash Two, reengage.

1146
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:43,250
如果能击落  就击落
If you get a clear shot, you take it.

1147
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,180
少校  我们都不知道那是什么
Major, we don't even know what we're shooting at.

1148
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:47,840
让猛禽回来
Call off the Raptors.

1149
01:23:47,850 --> 01:23:49,230
那玩意刚在合法禁飞区内
That thing just took out an F- 22

1150
01:23:49,230 --> 01:23:50,680
击落了一架F22
inside a legal no fly zone!

1151
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:53,370
鞭子二号  如果能击落  就击落
Whiplash Two, if you have a clear shot, take it!

1152
01:23:53,370 --> 01:23:55,830
你又被锁定了  进行躲避操作
You've been reengaged. Execute evasive manoeuvre.

1153
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:56,760
继续飞
Keep going!

1154
01:24:04,730 --> 01:24:06,790
降落伞打开
Good chute! Good chute!

1155
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:17,260
-托尼  你还在吗  -谢谢了
- Tony, you still there? - Hey, thanks.

1156
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:19,870
天呐  你个疯子
Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch.

1157
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:22,660
你欠我架飞机  你知道吧
You owe me a plane. You know that, right?

1158
01:24:23,950 --> 01:24:25,740
严格讲  是他撞了我
Yeah, well, technically, he hit me.

1159
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:27,710
你要过来看看我在做什么吗
Now are you going to come by and see what I'm working on?

1160
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:30,860
不要  我知道得越少越好
No, no, no, no, no, no, the less I know, the better.

1161
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:32,820
我要怎么跟媒体讲
Now, what am I supposed to tell the press?

1162
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:35,400
演练  一般不都用这套屁话吗
Training exercise. Isn't that the usual BS?

1163
01:24:35,410 --> 01:24:36,860
没那么简单
It's not that simple.

1164
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:39,870
昨天一架猛禽F22
An unfortunate training exercise

1165
01:24:39,870 --> 01:24:42,980
在演练中不幸发生事故
involving an F-22 Raptor occurred yesterday.

1166
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:46,720
庆幸的是  飞行员并未受伤
I am pleased to report that the pilot was not injured.

1167
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:50,700
至于科米拉村庄意料之外的局势反转
As for the unexpected turn of events on the ground in Gulmira,

1168
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:54,560
是谁或是什么进行了干预  我们尚不清楚
it is still unclear who or what intervened,

1169
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:55,830
但我可以保证
but I can assure you that

1170
01:24:55,830 --> 01:24:58,800
此事与美国政府无关
the United States government was not involved.

1171
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:05,450
的确很贴身  先生
It is a tight fit, sir.

1172
01:25:06,630 --> 01:25:09,480
先生  您越是扭动  就会越疼
Sir, the more you struggle, the more this is going to hurt.

1173
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:11,220
温柔点  这是我第一次
Be gentle. This is my first time.

1174
01:25:12,450 --> 01:25:14,410
我设计它能脱下来的  所以
I designed this to come off, so...

1175
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:17,910
我真的应该能
I really should be able to...

1176
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:20,480
请尽量不要动  先生
Please, try not to move, sir.

1177
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,220
怎么回事啊
What's going on here?

1178
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:29,290
承认吧
Let's face it.

1179
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:31,340
这不是你撞见我做的最糟糕的事
This is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.

1180
01:25:33,290 --> 01:25:34,850
那是弹孔吗
Are those bullet holes?

1181
01:26:02,670 --> 01:26:03,650
欢迎
Welcome.

1182
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:09,050
托尼·斯塔克的赠礼
Compliments of Tony Stark.

1183
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:11,860
如果你当初按计划杀了他
If you'd killed him when you were supposed to,

1184
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:13,460
也不会把脸烧掉了
you'd still have a face.

1185
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,160
你给我们点小钱杀一位王子
You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.

1186
01:26:16,210 --> 01:26:17,760
带我去看武器
Show me the weapon.

1187
01:26:19,170 --> 01:26:22,770
来吧  让守卫留在外面
Come. Leave your guards outside.

1188
01:26:39,470 --> 01:26:41,680
他的逃脱带来了意外的收获
His escape bore unexpected fruit.

1189
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,490
他就是这么做到的
So this is how he did it.

1190
01:26:46,930 --> 01:26:49,000
这只是首次的粗糙的尝试
This is only a first, crude effort.

1191
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:51,850
斯塔克已完善了他的设计
Stark has perfected his design.

1192
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:55,050
他制作了一件死亡杰作
He has made a masterpiece of death.

1193
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:58,670
有十几件这种战衣的人  能统治亚洲
A man with a dozen of these can rule all of Asia.

1194
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:02,410
你梦想夺下斯塔克的王位
And you dream of Stark's throne.

1195
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:06,090
我们有共同的敌人
We have a common enemy.

1196
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,450
如果我们还在合作
If we are still in business,

1197
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:17,530
我会把设计给你
I will give you these designs

1198
01:27:19,230 --> 01:27:20,290
当做礼物
as a gift.

1199
01:27:21,870 --> 01:27:22,960
作为交换
And in turn,

1200
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,630
希望你能礼尚往来
I hope you'll repay me

1201
01:27:27,850 --> 01:27:30,420
给我钢铁战士
with a gift of iron soldiers.

1202
01:27:41,050 --> 01:27:43,920
这是你唯一会得到的礼物
This is the only gift you shall receive.

1203
01:27:46,990 --> 01:27:48,210
科技
Technology.

1204
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:53,320
在世界的这一带一直是个致命弱点
It's always been your Achilles' heel in this part of the world.

1205
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,470
别担心  只会持续15分钟
Don't worry. It'll only last for 1 5 minutes.

1206
01:27:59,310 --> 01:28:01,300
这是你最不需要担心的事了
That's the least of your problems.

1207
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:09,250
把装甲和其余的装箱带走
Crate up the armour and the rest of it.

1208
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:13,180
好  我们做个了结吧
All right, let's finish up here.

1209
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:20,210
让方舟反应堆下的16区做好准备
Set up Sector 16 underneath the arc reactor,

1210
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:22,280
我需要遮蔽这些数据
and I'm going to want this data masked.

1211
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:23,970
找来我们最好的工程师
Recruit our top engineers.

1212
01:28:23,970 --> 01:28:25,790
马上给我造个原型机
I want a prototype right away.

1213
01:28:35,070 --> 01:28:36,940
你忙吗  可以替我去办件事吗
You busy? You mind if I send you on an errand?

1214
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:39,220
我需要你去我办公室
I need you to go to my office.

1215
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:41,080
黑入主机
You're going to hack into the mainframe

1216
01:28:41,090 --> 01:28:42,970
拿到所有最近的运输清单
and you're going to retrieve all the recent shipping manifests.

1217
01:28:42,970 --> 01:28:44,480
这是锁定芯片
This is a lock chip.

1218
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:46,430
能让你黑进去
This'll get you in.

1219
01:28:46,830 --> 01:28:48,470
大概是在执行文档里
It's probably under Executive Files.

1220
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:50,300
要不  就是在幽灵驱动上
If not, they put it on a ghost drive,

1221
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:52,920
那样的话  你就得查找标题数码最小的
in which case you need to look for the lowest numeric heading.

1222
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:55,670
如果我拿回了信息
And what do you plan to do with this information

1223
01:28:55,670 --> 01:28:56,540
你打算怎么做呢
if I bring it back here?

1224
01:28:56,550 --> 01:28:57,590
还是那套
Same drill.

1225
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,640
他们在暗箱操作  我要阻止他们
They've been dealing under the table, and I'm going to stop them.

1226
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:02,720
我要找到我的武器  摧毁它们
I'm going to find my weapons and destroy them.

1227
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:04,560
托尼
Tony,

1228
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:09,100
你知道我愿帮你做任何事
you know that I would help you with anything,

1229
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:13,130
但如果你又要这么胡来  我就不能帮你
but I cannot help you if you're going to start all of this again.

1230
01:29:13,130 --> 01:29:17,050
除了这个  别无其他  没有艺术馆开幕
There is nothing except this. There's no art opening.

1231
01:29:17,050 --> 01:29:20,490
或是慈善晚会  或是签什么字
There is no benefit. There is nothing to sign.

1232
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:24,790
只有下一项任务  没有别的
There is the next mission and nothing else.

1233
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:26,860
是吗
Is that so?

1234
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,600
那我辞职
Well, then, I quit.

1235
01:29:33,730 --> 01:29:35,480
这么多年来  你一直在我身边
You stood by my side all these years

1236
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:38,070
看着我收获毁灭的利益
while I reaped the benefits of destruction.

1237
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:40,530
现在我想保护那些
And now that I'm trying to protect the people

1238
01:29:40,530 --> 01:29:42,420
因我而身陷危险的人  你却要走人吗
that I put in harm's way, you're going to walk out?

1239
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:44,420
你会害死自己的  托尼
You're going to kill yourself, Tony.

1240
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:46,790
我不要助你一臂之力
I'm not going to be a part of it.

1241
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,420
我本不该活下来的
I shouldn't be alive,

1242
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:51,910
除非这有什么意义
unless it was for a reason.

1243
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:54,840
我没疯  派珀
I'm not crazy, Pepper.

1244
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:59,190
我就是终于知道  我该做什么了
I just finally know what I have to do.

1245
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:06,210
我心里知道  这是对的
And I know in my heart that it's right.

1246
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:23,450
你也是我的一切了

You did not tell us that the target you paid us to kill

1255
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:55,760
是了不起的托尼·斯塔克
was the great Tony Stark.

1256
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:56,580
-你可以看到  -天呐
- As you can see, - Oh, my God.

奥巴代亚·斯坦尼
Obadiah Stane...

你的欺骗和谎言会让你付出高额代价
...your deception and lies will cost you dearly.

1259
01:32:00,270 --> 01:32:03,250
杀托尼·斯塔克的价钱刚刚涨了
The price to kill Tony Stark has just gone up.

So, what are we going to do about this?

1262
01:32:23,370 --> 01:32:26,960
我理解你现在的处境  派珀
I know what you're going through, Pepper.

1263
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:38,140
托尼  他的东西总是好的  是吧
Tony. He always gets the good stuff, doesn't he?

1264
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:04,190
他回家时我好开心
I was so happy when he came home.

1265
01:33:04,190 --> 01:33:06,890
就好像他死而复生了
It was like we got him back from the dead.

1266
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,710
现在我意识到
Now I realise,

1267
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:17,750
托尼其实根本没有回家来  是吧
well, Tony never really did come home, did he?

1268
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:22,140
他把自己的一部分留在了那个洞里
He left a part of himself in that cave.

1269
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:26,020
伤透了我的心
Breaks my heart.

1270
01:33:28,630 --> 01:33:33,060
他是个复杂的人
Well, he's a complicated person.

1271
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:38,760
他经受了很多事  我觉得他会没事的
He's been through a lot. I think he'll be all right.

托尼不知道自己多么幸运

01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:07,180
这些武器会把世界拉回正轨
Weapons that will help steer the world back on course,

1336
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:09,560
让权力落在我们手中
put the balance of power in our hands.

1337
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:12,410
合适的手中
The right hands.

1338
01:38:15,790 --> 01:38:20,730
真希望你能看到我的原型机
I wish you could see my prototype.

1339
01:38:21,690 --> 01:38:22,990
虽然不像
It's not as...

1340
01:38:24,710 --> 01:38:27,660
不像你的那个那么保守
Well, not as conservative as yours.

1341
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:32,170
可惜你还把派珀卷了进来
Too bad you had to involve Pepper in this.

1342
01:38:32,860 --> 01:38:35,020
我本来更想留她一命的
I would have preferred that she lived.

1343
01:38:48,450 --> 01:38:50,780
什么意思  他花钱雇人去杀托尼
What do you mean, he paid to have Tony killed?

1344
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:53,410
派珀  慢点说  奥巴代亚为什么要
Pepper, slow down. Why would Obadiah...

1345
01:38:54,730 --> 01:38:56,030
好吧  托尼现在在哪
Okay, where's Tony now?

1346
01:38:56,030 --> 01:38:57,800
我不知道  他不接电话
I don't know. He's not answering his phone.

1347
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:00,100
请你过去一趟  确保他没事
Please go over there and make sure everything's okay.

1348
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:03,000
谢谢  罗德  我知道条近路
Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.

1349
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:10,120
乖
Good boy.

1350
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:51,070
托尼
Tony?

1351
01:40:53,890 --> 01:40:54,910
托尼
Tony!

1352
01:40:56,660 --> 01:40:57,680
托尼
Tony!

1353
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:01,010
托尼
Tony!

1354
01:41:03,780 --> 01:41:04,770
托尼
Tony!

1355
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:09,330
托尼  你没事吧
Tony! You okay?

1356
01:41:09,860 --> 01:41:10,760
派珀呢
Where's Pepper?

1357
01:41:11,570 --> 01:41:13,470
她没事  她身边有五个特工呢
She's fine. She's with five agents.

1358
01:41:13,470 --> 01:41:15,030
他们要去逮捕奥巴代亚了
They're about to arrest Obadiah.

1359
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:17,290
那不够
That's not going to be enough.

1360
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:43,370
16区
Section 16.

1361
01:41:44,610 --> 01:41:46,220
16区
Section 16.

1362
01:41:46,990 --> 01:41:48,120
在那儿呢
There it is.

1363
01:41:56,850 --> 01:41:59,070
我的钥匙没用  打不开门
My key's not working. It's not opening the door.

1364
01:42:00,270 --> 01:42:01,700
那是什么  小装置吗
What's that? It's, like, a little device?

1365
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:03,480
能开锁吗
It's, like, a thing that's going to pick the lock?

1366
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:05,070
你最好退后几步
You might want to take a few steps back.

1367
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:27,290
那真是我见过的最酷的东西
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

1368
01:42:27,290 --> 01:42:28,460
不赖吧
Not bad, huh?

1369
01:42:29,470 --> 01:42:30,340
我们来吧
Let's do it.

1370
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,750
还需要我做什么吗
You need me to do anything else?

1371
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:41,210
别让人上天搅局
Keep the skies clear.

1372
01:42:46,700 --> 01:42:47,720
我去
Damn!

1373
01:42:55,990 --> 01:42:57,420
下次吧  宝贝
Next time, baby.

1374
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:31,310
看来你是对的  他是在造战衣
Looks like you were right. He was building a suit.

1375
01:43:31,740 --> 01:43:33,260
我以为会更大些呢
I thought it'd be bigger.

1376
01:44:18,750 --> 01:44:19,750
干掉他
Take him out!

1377
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:32,710
你觉得马克1号的胸膛电源能不能撑得住
How do you think the Mark I chest piece is going to hold up?

1378
01:44:32,710 --> 01:44:34,970
战衣电力为48%  还在减少  先生
The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir.

1379
01:44:34,970 --> 01:44:37,970
这块胸膛电源不是设计用来飞行的
That chest piece was never designed for sustained flight.

1380
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:38,890
随时通知我情况
Keep me posted.

1381
01:44:41,150 --> 01:44:42,030
派珀
Pepper!

1382
01:44:42,030 --> 01:44:43,900
托尼  你没事吧
Tony! Tony, are you okay?

1383
01:44:43,900 --> 01:44:45,060
我没事  你怎么...
I'm fine. How are...

1384
01:44:45,060 --> 01:44:47,180
-奥巴代亚  他疯了  -我知道
- Obadiah, he's gone insane! - I know.

1385
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:49,000
-你最好赶紧走  -他建了套战衣
- Listen, you'd better get out of there. - He built a suit.

1386
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,470
快点  马上走
Get out of there right now!

1387
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:04,090
你想去哪
Where do you think you're going?

1388
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:12,900
我不再需要你的服务了
Your services are no longer required.

1389
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:15,060
斯坦尼
Stane!

1390
01:45:40,180 --> 01:45:41,920
我爱这套战衣
I love this suit!

1391
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:45,280
-把他们放下  -附带伤害  托尼
- Put them down! - Collateral damage, Tony.

1392
01:45:46,650 --> 01:45:48,280
向胸膛转移能量
Divert power to chest RT.

1393
01:45:57,670 --> 01:45:59,620
能量仅剩19%
Power reduced to 19%.

1394
01:46:07,430 --> 01:46:08,460
女士
Lady!

1395
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:12,230
不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1396
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:37,520
30年了  我一直捧着你
For 30 years, I've been holding you up!

1397
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,270
我从零建立起了这家公司
I built this company from nothing!

1398
01:46:46,590 --> 01:46:49,150
什么都别想妨碍我
Nothing is going to stand in my way.

1399
01:46:55,460 --> 01:46:58,230
你更别想
Least of all you!

1400
01:47:07,390 --> 01:47:11,110
厉害  你升级了你的盔甲
Impressive! You've upgraded your armour!

1401
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:13,630
我自己也有升级
I've made some upgrades of my own!

1402
01:47:22,310 --> 01:47:24,350
先生  他的战衣似乎能飞
Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.

1403
01:47:24,350 --> 01:47:26,220
发现了  带我飞到最高高度
Duly noted. Take me to maximum altitude.

1404
01:47:26,220 --> 01:47:27,620
现在只有15%的电力
With only 15% power,

1405
01:47:27,620 --> 01:47:28,550
达到这高度的可能性
the odds of reaching that...

1406
01:47:28,550 --> 01:47:30,590
我会算算数  照做
I know the math! Do it!

1407
01:47:39,010 --> 01:47:41,350
长官  你不会相信的  那玩意回来了
Sir, you're not going to believe this. That thing is back.

1408
01:47:41,350 --> 01:47:43,530
接艾伦少校  集结飞机
Get me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!

1409
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:49,760
不必了  各位  只是演练
Not necessary, people. Just a training exercise.

1410
01:47:50,060 --> 01:47:50,970
是  长官
Yes, sir.

1411
01:47:58,870 --> 01:48:00,350
只剩13%的电力了  先生
Thirteen percent power, sir.

1412
01:48:00,350 --> 01:48:01,170
继续爬升
Climb!

1413
01:48:04,970 --> 01:48:06,990
-11%  -继续飞
- Eleven percent. - Keep going!

1414
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:15,850
-电力为7%  -在屏幕上显示就行
- Seven percent power. - Just leave it on the screen!

1415
01:48:15,850 --> 01:48:16,880
别说了
Stop telling me!

1416
01:48:27,210 --> 01:48:28,790
你的点子很棒  托尼
You had a great idea, Tony,

1417
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:31,690
但我的战衣在各方面都更先进
but my suit is more advanced in every way!

1418
01:48:32,300 --> 01:48:34,060
你怎么解决结冰问题的
How'd you solve the icing problem?

1419
01:48:34,450 --> 01:48:35,770
什么结冰问题
Icing problem?

1420
01:48:38,190 --> 01:48:39,630
最好查看一下
Might want to look into it.

1421
01:48:52,140 --> 01:48:53,280
2%
Two percent.

1422
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:58,230
现在在使用紧急备用电力
We are now running on emergency backup power.

1423
01:49:10,130 --> 01:49:13,710
-波茨  -托尼  天呐  你没事吧
- Potts! - Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?

1424
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:15,050
我快没电了
I'm almost out of power.

1425
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:17,360
我得脱掉战衣  我就过去
I've got to get out of this thing. I'll be right there.

1426
01:49:17,890 --> 01:49:19,150
想得美
Nice try!

1427
01:49:32,210 --> 01:49:33,770
武器状态
Weapons status?

1428
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:36,500
冲击系统下线  导弹下线
Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.

1429
01:49:40,410 --> 01:49:41,410
燃烧弹
Flares!

1430
01:49:50,370 --> 01:49:52,590
真聪明  托尼
Very clever, Tony.

1431
01:49:57,790 --> 01:50:00,330
-波茨  -托尼
- Potts? - Tony!

1432
01:50:00,330 --> 01:50:00,910
这样不行
This isn't working.

1433
01:50:00,910 --> 01:50:03,540
我们得过载反应堆  炸碎屋顶
We're going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof.

1434
01:50:03,790 --> 01:50:06,680
-你要怎么做到  -你来做
- Well, how are you going to do that? - You're going to do it.

1435
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:09,220
去中央控制台  打开所有电路
Go to the central console, open up all the circuits.

1436
01:50:09,220 --> 01:50:10,520
等我撤离了屋顶  就告诉你
When I get clear of the roof, I'll let you know.

1437
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:12,920
你就按下主旁路按钮
You're going to hit the master bypass button.

1438
01:50:13,510 --> 01:50:15,170
上面的一切都会被烧毁
It's going to fry everything up here.

1439
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,340
好  我这就进去
Okay. I'm going in now.

1440
01:50:19,350 --> 01:50:22,490
一定等我离开屋顶的  我给你争取点时间
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof. I'll buy you some time.

1441
01:50:32,150 --> 01:50:33,600
这个看上去挺重要
This looks important!

1442
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:57,370
我一向不怎么喜欢这种玩意
I never had a taste for this sort of thing,

1443
01:50:57,800 --> 01:51:02,070
但我得承认  我非常喜欢这件战衣
but I must admit, I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

1444
01:51:10,140 --> 01:51:12,620
你可算超常发挥了  托尼
You finally outdid yourself, Tony!

1445
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:17,200
你会让你父亲自豪的
You'd have made your father proud!

1446
01:51:22,150 --> 01:51:24,240
准备好了  托尼  快离开屋顶
It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!

1447
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:45,630
托尼
Tony!

1448
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:48,450
真是讽刺  托尼
How ironic, Tony!

1449
01:51:50,230 --> 01:51:52,330
你想让世界上不再有武器
Trying to rid the world of weapons,

1450
01:51:52,930 --> 01:51:55,150
却发明了最棒的武器
you gave it its best one ever!

1451
01:51:55,150 --> 01:51:57,470
-派珀  -现在
- Pepper! - And now

1452
01:51:59,180 --> 01:52:01,000
我要拿它杀了你
I'm going to kill you with it!

1453
01:52:04,230 --> 01:52:08,220
-你扯掉了我的瞄准系统  -按按钮
- You ripped out my targeting system! - Time to hit the button!

1454
01:52:08,220 --> 01:52:12,230
-你叫我别按的  -别动  你个小混蛋
- You told me not to! - Hold still, you little prick!

1455
01:52:14,090 --> 01:52:17,040
-动手吧  -你会死的
- Just do it! - You'll die!

1456
01:52:19,890 --> 01:52:21,240
按吧
Push it!

1457
01:53:18,750 --> 01:53:20,290
托尼
Tony!

1458
01:53:28,910 --> 01:53:30,860
各位都拿到了昨晚斯塔克工业
You've all received the official statement of

1459
01:53:28,990 --> 01:53:40,710
{\an8}詹姆斯·罗德中校  斯塔克工业事件

1460
01:53:30,860 --> 01:53:33,350
事件经过的官方报告
what occurred at Stark lndustries last night.

1461
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:35,640
有未经证实的报告称
There have been unconfirmed reports

1462
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:38,460
一件机器人原型机发生故障
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned

1463
01:53:38,460 --> 01:53:41,130
导致方舟反应堆受损
and caused damage to the arc reactor.

1464
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:44,180
幸好  托尼·斯塔克的一位私人保镖
Fortunately, a member of Tony Stark's personal security staff...

1465
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:44,790
{\an8}钢铁侠是谁

1466
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:46,130
"钢铁侠"  挺上口  挺响亮的
"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy. It's got a nice ring to it.

1467
01:53:46,130 --> 01:53:47,480
虽然并不准确
I mean, it's not technically accurate.

1468
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:49,860
战衣是金钛合金
The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,

1469
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:52,650
但这种意向呼之欲出
but it's kind of evocative, the imagery, anyway.

1470
01:53:52,660 --> 01:53:53,840
这是你的不在场证明
Here's your alibi.

1471
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,250
好
Okay.

1472
01:53:56,330 --> 01:53:58,560
-你在你的游艇上  -嗯
- You were on your yacht. - Yeah.

1473
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:00,750
我们有港口报告证明你整晚都在阿瓦隆
We have port papers that put you in Avalon all night,

1474
01:54:00,750 --> 01:54:02,690
还有你50位宾客的宣誓证词
and sworn statements from 50 of your guests.

1475
01:54:02,690 --> 01:54:05,750
或许该说只有我和派珀
See, I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me

1476
01:54:05,750 --> 01:54:07,630
单独在岛上
alone on the island.

1477
01:54:08,890 --> 01:54:10,240
-就是这样的  -好吧
- That's what happened. - All right.

1478
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:11,810
照读就行
Just read it, word for word.

1479
01:54:14,290 --> 01:54:15,740
上面没提斯坦尼
There's nothing about Stane here.

1480
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:19,400
这已经处理好了  他去度假了
That's being handled. He's on vacation.

1481
01:54:19,950 --> 01:54:22,490
小型飞机的安全记录很差
Small aircraft have such a poor safety record.

1482
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:25,180
但关于保镖的那套掩护说辞呢
But what about the whole cover story that it's a bodyguard?

1483
01:54:25,180 --> 01:54:26,430
他是我的...这...
He's my... I mean, is that...

1484
01:54:26,430 --> 01:54:27,990
这太站不住脚了吧
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

1485
01:54:28,130 --> 01:54:30,190
我不是第一次做这种事了  斯塔克先生
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr Stark.

1486
01:54:30,510 --> 01:54:31,670
按官方说辞念就行
Just stick to the official statement,

1487
01:54:31,670 --> 01:54:33,690
很快  这一切都会过去了
and soon, this will all be behind you.

1488
01:54:34,620 --> 01:54:37,090
你有90秒
You've got 90 seconds.

1489
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:40,830
科尔森特工
Agent Coulson?

1490
01:54:42,090 --> 01:54:46,330
我想说  非常感谢你的一切帮助
I just wanted to say thank you very much for all of your help.

1491
01:54:46,660 --> 01:54:49,670
这是我们的职责  我们还会再联系的
That's what we do. You'll be hearing from us.

1492
01:54:49,860 --> 01:54:53,060
-你们叫国土战略  -喊我们神盾局就行
- From the Strategic Homeland... - Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

1493
01:54:53,670 --> 01:54:54,630
好
Right.

1494
01:54:55,770 --> 01:54:57,390
我们开始吧
Let's get this show on the road.

1495
01:54:57,390 --> 01:54:59,610
其实也没那么糟
You know, it's actually not that bad.

1496
01:54:59,610 --> 01:55:01,310
就连我都不觉得自己像钢铁侠
Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.

1497
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:03,740
-你不是钢铁侠  -我是
- You're not Iron Man. - Am so.

1498
01:55:03,740 --> 01:55:05,770
-你不是  -好吧  随你
- You're not. - All right, suit yourself.

1499
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:07,760
如果我是钢铁侠
You know, if I were Iron Man,

1500
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:10,200
我会有个知道我真实身份的女友
I'd have this girlfriend who knew my true identity.

1501
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:11,040
而且她会很崩溃
She'd be a wreck,

1502
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:12,780
因为她会非常担心我会不会送命
'cause she'd always be worrying that I was going to die,

1503
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:15,370
但又为我的成就感到骄傲
yet so proud of the man I'd become.

1504
01:55:15,370 --> 01:55:19,890
她会非常矛盾  而这又让她更加
She'd be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more

1505
01:55:21,020 --> 01:55:21,950
为我疯狂了
crazy about me.

1506
01:55:21,950 --> 01:55:23,730
你难道就没想过那晚的事吗
Tell me you never think about that night.

1507
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:25,290
-哪一晚  -你知道的
- What night? - You know.

1508
01:55:28,570 --> 01:55:29,740
你是说
Are you talking about

1509
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:31,770
我们一起跳舞的那晚吗
the night that we danced

1510
01:55:31,770 --> 01:55:34,250
然后我们上了屋顶
and went up on the roof,

1511
01:55:35,930 --> 01:55:37,150
然后
and then

1512
01:55:38,370 --> 01:55:41,620
你去楼下拿酒
you went downstairs to get me a drink,

1513
01:55:41,620 --> 01:55:45,340
然后就撇下了我一人
and you left me there, by myself?

1514
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:47,840
你是说那晚吗
Is that the night you're talking about?

1515
01:55:50,890 --> 01:55:52,020
我猜也是
Thought so.

1516
01:55:54,610 --> 01:55:55,510
没有别的事了吧  斯塔克先生
Will that be all, Mr Stark?

1517
01:55:55,510 --> 01:55:58,470
是的  没别的事了  波茨小姐
Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

1518
01:55:58,470 --> 01:56:02,070
现在  斯塔克先生准备了一份声明
And now, Mr Stark has prepared a statement.

1519
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:05,200
他不会接受提问的  谢谢
He will not be taking any questions. Thank you.

1520
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:11,520
自我上次见大家过去好一阵了
Been a while since I was in front of you.

1521
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:13,450
我这次还是照稿读吧
I figure I'll stick to the cards this time.

1522
01:56:16,390 --> 01:56:17,330
有人猜测
There's been speculation

1523
01:56:17,330 --> 01:56:19,410
我卷入了之前发生在
that I was involved in the events that occurred

1524
01:56:19,410 --> 01:56:20,680
高速和屋顶上的事件
on the freeway and the rooftop...

1525
01:56:20,680 --> 01:56:21,790
抱歉  斯塔克先生
I'm sorry, Mr Stark,

1526
01:56:21,790 --> 01:56:23,650
你真的指望我们相信
but do you honestly expect us to believe that

1527
01:56:23,650 --> 01:56:27,540
那是一个穿战衣的保镖  碰巧出现
that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared,

1528
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:30,320
-尽管你...  -我知道情况让人糊涂
- despite the fact that you... - I know that it's confusing.

1529
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:33,400
质疑官方说辞是一回事
It is one thing to question the official story,

1530
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:35,740
但提出疯狂指控  或暗示说
and another thing entirely to make wild accusations,

1531
01:56:35,740 --> 01:56:37,900
我是个超级英雄可是另一码事了
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

1532
01:56:37,900 --> 01:56:39,580
我可没说你是超级英雄
I never said you were a superhero.

1533
01:56:39,580 --> 01:56:41,140
是吗  那很好
Didn't? Well, good,

1534
01:56:41,140 --> 01:56:45,300
因为那是不着边际  异想天开的
because that would be outlandish and fantastic.

1535
01:56:46,890 --> 01:56:50,540
我显然不是做英雄的料
I'm just not the hero type. Clearly.

1536
01:56:50,710 --> 01:56:53,810
我有一堆性格缺陷
With this laundry list of character defects,

1537
01:56:53,810 --> 01:56:55,260
犯过那么多错误
all the mistakes I've made,

1538
01:56:55,260 --> 01:56:58,740
-还很公开  -照稿读就行
- largely public. - Just stick to the cards, man.

1539
01:56:58,740 --> 01:57:00,650
好  好
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1540
01:57:02,510 --> 01:57:03,590
事实就是
The truth is

1541
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:11,560
我就是钢铁侠
I am Iron Man.

1542
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:15,970
贾维斯
Jarvis!

1543
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:18,180
欢迎回家  先生
Welcome home, sir.

1544
02:05:21,400 --> 02:05:23,490
"我就是钢铁侠"
"I am Iron Man."

1545
02:05:24,330 --> 02:05:27,060
你以为你是这世上唯一的超级英雄吗
You think you're the only superhero in the world?

1546
02:05:27,290 --> 02:05:28,000
斯塔克先生
Mr Stark,

1547
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,420
你已经成为了更大的宇宙的一部分
you've become part of a bigger universe.

1548
02:05:30,460 --> 02:05:32,750
你只是现在还不知道
You just don't know it yet.

1549
02:05:32,860 --> 02:05:34,040
你是谁
Who the hell are you?

1550
02:05:34,940 --> 02:05:37,700
尼克·弗瑞  神盾局局长
Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1551
02:05:39,670 --> 02:05:42,300
我来跟你谈谈复仇者联盟
I'm here to talk to you about the Avenger Initiative.
